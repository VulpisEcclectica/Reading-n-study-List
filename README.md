# Reading n study List

Ok so the name says most of it but – Essentially this is just a place to keep track of the reading and study I do on the side for fun. the kind of stuff my book-tracker wouldn't really deal with. Now it may seem like from these options im a bit of an ego-tistical nerd... and well truth be told I kind of am, but to be fair I do read some other more literary sort of stuff – so if for some strange reason you'd be interested in what id have to say I'll put the bookwyrm link at the bottom of this readme, and its in my profile too!

With that messy into out of the way we can get started:

## To Read: ##

> * "Navigating the dark Web: A comprehensive Guide to Darknets, Tools and Intelligence" by sebastian damaye
  (Note on the last one: interesting sounding title but may not finish if it starts getting too 'digital-forenzics'-flavoured, here to learn about tech not peoples views on ethics    [we have 'intro to anarchism', 'capitalism and nothingness', etc for that]... also while I am all for reading things from different perspectives I personally can't stand works      that get too cop-y or capitalisty)
> * The Rust programming language by Steve Klabnik, Carol Nichols, and Chris Krycho
  (need to brush back up on my C first though, and perhaps a little x86_64 ASM for masochism and fun)
> * OSDev.org Wiki
  (one day she says wistfully)
