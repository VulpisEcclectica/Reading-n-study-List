This first section very much retreads basic concepts though still worth reading as on occassion it gives deeper insight to their backbones, I assume will mostly be general sumaries.

## 0.0 ##
General summary: 
  - Interesting recap, a few deeper peeks at the foundations
  - Discussed in more details; methods of exhaustion, limits, pi, area and rate of change (i.e. problems solved by integrals and derivatives respecitvely)
  - Breif overview of the applications in various other areas of study.
## 1.1 ##
General sumary: 
  - Discusses various ways to represent functions and the basic core concept of functions as transformation of inputs x -> f(x) (e.g. if f(x) = $x^2$ -> when x = 4, f(x) = 16)
  - Representations include: Tables, graphs, word form and algebraic (algebraic being what we are most likely used to)
  - Revisits contexts in which seperate reperesntations of the same function may pose certain benifits or drawbacks
## 1.2 ##
General sumary:
  - Re-introduces the process of mathmematical modeling and it's steps
  - Starting with examining a real world problem
  - then producing a mathematical model
  - from this model mathematical conclusions can be made
  - which may then generate real world predictions
  - these predictions often raise more questions begining the cycle again
  - this chapter also reminds of various common functions used in mathematical modeling drawing on the concepts in 1.1 to discuss; linear, polynomial (and their single term subset power functions), triganometric functions (remember to use radians), exponential and logarithmic functions
## 1.3 ##
Transformations of functions
